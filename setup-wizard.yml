    title: Checkpoint for fast sync
    description: >-
      To get Nimbus up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Nimbus from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features. Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync.
      Get your checkpoint sync from a running gnosis beacon chain node or use the official one **https://rpc-gbc.gnosischain.com/**
